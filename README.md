# Game Mechanics
- Cars: Randomly generated cars move horizontally across the screen. The turtle must avoid these cars while crossing the road.
- Level Up: Each time the turtle reaches the top of the screen, it advances to the next level and the car speed increases.
- Game Over: If the turtle collides with a car, the game ends, and a "Game Over" message is displayed.
